# GLAU Firewall Authenticator - Android App
An App for automatic firewall authentication within GLA University's Network for seamless Internet connectivity.

## Motivation
The network firewall only allows the Internet access for 600 seconds (keeps changing, but never goes infinite :p), beyond that, the user has to login again to gain access for another short span.
